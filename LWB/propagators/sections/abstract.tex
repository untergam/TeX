\begin{abstract}
	This article explains the central design decisions and most important code details related to the efficient implementation of time propagation for Hagedorn wave packets in the WaveBlocks framework.
	A short introduction to operator splitting and a summary of some of the most important time propagation schemes for Hagedorn wave packets are also given.
	Finally, some benchmark results are presented which analyze energy conservation and compare different propagators, splitting schemes, step sizes and dimensionalities.
